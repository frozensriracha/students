The OSS project I have decided to contribute to is OpenRCT2 (https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2), an open-source reimplementation of a game called Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. There are 599 contributors and there are a total of 861,338 lines of code, distributed among 1,474 files. There have been 27,907 commits total and over 50 of those have been during the past 7 days, the most recent of which being 11 hours ago at the time I'm writing this. In all the most recent issues that have responses, the issue was responded to within a day, occasionally 2. External contributions seem to happen fairly regularly, with the latest one being about a week ago. I feel like this project would be suitable for me to contribute to because while there are some beginner-friendly aspects, it would also offer a challenge. I also want to contribute to this project because the language is mostly C++, the coding language I'm most proficient in and want to practice for the real-world applications, as well as enjoying developing games.
